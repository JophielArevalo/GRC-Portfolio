# GRC Portfolio (by Jophiel Arevalo Enriquez)

This portfolio curates my Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) artifacts derived from **IT & Cybersecurity Governance, Policy, Ethics and Law**. It captures my ability to translate theory into practical, reusable work products across governance frameworks, security policies, incident management, technology ethics, cyber risk, insurance, and remote work.

## Structure
- **governance-frameworks/** — COBIT & ITIL analysis and my Module 1 report.
- **policies/** — Ethical hacking, data breach response, remote work policy, plus executive/notification templates.
- **incident-mgmt/** — Maturity model, improvement roadmap, and a quick visual table.
- **technology-ethics/** — AI ethics in hiring, OSS licensing ethics, and inclusive design for LGBTQ+ safety.
- **risk-analysis/** — Ransomware risk, cyber insurance, and a portfolio summary.

## How I approached this work
I grounded each artifact in established frameworks (e.g., **ITIL**, **COBIT**) and regulatory context (e.g., **OAIC’s Notifiable Data Breaches scheme**), then translated them into action-oriented deliverables suitable for internal stakeholders and executives.

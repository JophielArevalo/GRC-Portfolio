DATA BREACH RESPONSE PLAN

I created a structured response plan for data breaches with clearly defined roles across technical, legal, and communication teams.

The plan follows four stages:
1. Contain — isolate systems, revoke access, secure evidence  
2. Assess — understand what happened, what data was affected, and who is at risk  
3. Notify — inform affected individuals and internal stakeholders, provide guidance  
4. Review — identify lessons learned and strengthen controls

This plan ensures quick action, clear accountability, and improved resilience after each incident.

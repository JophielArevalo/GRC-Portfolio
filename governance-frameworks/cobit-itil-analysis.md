# COBIT & ITIL Analysis — First Person

## Introduction
I analysed a company experiencing customer dissatisfaction and repeated compliance failures. To address these issues, I combined ITIL to improve service quality and COBIT to reinforce governance, control, and alignment with business goals.

## What I Evaluated
- ITIL helped me focus on service design, delivery, and continuous improvement.
- COBIT guided me in strengthening internal controls, accountability, and IT governance structures.
- The challenge was sequencing these frameworks realistically based on the organisation’s maturity.

## My Roadmap
1. Identify mandatory compliance requirements.  
2. Perform an independent baseline assessment.  
3. Implement ITIL service practices and COBIT governance controls.  
4. Establish ongoing monitoring and improvement cycles.

## Conclusion
By integrating ITIL and COBIT, I created a balanced and achievable plan that improved customer experience while strengthening the organisation’s governance foundations.

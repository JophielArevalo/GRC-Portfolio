MODULE 1 — IT Framework Management Plan

I conducted a self-evaluation of the company’s IT governance posture and determined that improving both service quality and compliance required a dual-framework approach.

I used ITIL to guide improvements in IT service management and COBIT to strengthen internal controls, compliance, and alignment with business goals.

My plan included identifying applicable standards, commissioning an external audit, implementing controls in phases, and maintaining continuous monitoring.

This approach allowed me to uplift IT performance and rebuild organisational trust.

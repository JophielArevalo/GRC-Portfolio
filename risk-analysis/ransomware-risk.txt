RANSOMWARE RISK 

I analysed a ransomware attack scenario for a manufacturing company.

I identified risks such as operational shutdowns, data loss, and financial extortion. I emphasised preventive controls like patching, segmentation, MFA, and frequent immutable backups.

I also developed user awareness campaigns and incident response playbooks to improve resilience.

This approach prepared the organisation for both prevention and fast recovery.

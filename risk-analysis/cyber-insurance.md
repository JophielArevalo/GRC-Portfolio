# Cyber Insurance

I evaluated cyber insurance as a way to handle residual risk that cannot be mitigated through controls alone.

I assessed policy components such as incident response coverage, business interruption, legal liability, data restoration, and notification costs.

I matched these requirements with the organisation’s existing security maturity to determine eligibility and cost-effectiveness.

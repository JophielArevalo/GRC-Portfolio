INCIDENT MANAGEMENT MATURITY MODEL

I evaluated incident management capabilities across five areas:

Prepare — roles, plans, and insider threat program  
Protect — risk assessments and malware prevention  
Detect — monitoring and penetration testing  
Respond — reporting, coordination, and analysis  
Sustain — third‑party agreements and training

I prioritised moving foundational capabilities from basic to defined, then maturing into managed levels where processes become repeatable and reliable.

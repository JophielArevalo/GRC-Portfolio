# Incident Management Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Immediate  
I deployed monitoring tools, improved logging, and trained staff on phishing and social engineering threats.

## Phase 2 — Short Term  
I ran tabletop exercises, refined incident response playbooks, and created recovery plans for critical systems.

## Phase 3 — Long Term  
I established long‑term review cycles, performance indicators, and deeper coordination with third‑party providers.

AI ETHICS IN HIRING

I examined an AI hiring system that produced biased outcomes and created fairness and transparency risks.

I prioritised eliminating bias, ensuring equal treatment of candidates, improving transparency, and preventing legal exposure.

My recommendations included pausing the system, auditing it for bias, removing harmful features, documenting decisions, and ensuring human oversight in final selections.

This approach ensured ethical hiring practices while supporting responsible technology use.

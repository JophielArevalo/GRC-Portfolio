OSS LICENSING ETHICS

I analysed the ethical implications of using open‑source software in a sensitive data analysis tool.

I compared permissive licenses with copyleft and chose copyleft as the safer option because it requires derivative work to be shared back, ensuring transparency.

I also considered ethical constraints and governance structures to prevent misuse without limiting innovation.

This balance helped me protect users while maintaining openness.

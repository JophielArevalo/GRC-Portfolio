INCLUSIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR SOCIAL GOOD

I designed a concept for an inclusive digital platform to support LGBTQ+ individuals, offering safe spaces, psychological support, and educational resources.

I integrated principles like equity, privacy, accessibility, multilingual support, and safety features for users in hostile environments.

I also established stakeholder engagement loops and privacy-preserving defaults to protect vulnerable users.

This work demonstrated how ethical design can support social good.
